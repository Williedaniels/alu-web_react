# Starting Your Project with Create React App

This project was initiated using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.

## Key Commands

Inside your project folder, you have access to these commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.\
Visit <http://localhost:3000> in your web browser to see it running.

The page will automatically refresh whenever you save changes to your code.\
Any code style issues (lint errors) might also appear in your terminal.

### `npm test`

Activates the test runner in an interactive mode that watches for file changes.\
For more details on how to execute tests, refer to the documentation.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production deployment into the `build` directory.\
This process correctly bundles React for a production environment and applies optimizations for peak performance.

The resulting build is compressed (minified), and output filenames include unique identifiers (hashes).\
Your application is now ready to be deployed!

Consult the section on deployment for further guidance.

### `npm run eject`

**Important: This action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert!**

Should you find the default build tools and configuration unsatisfactory, you have the option to `eject` at any point. This command removes the single build dependency provided by Create React App.

Instead, it copies all the underlying configuration files and their related dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This gives you complete control over the setup. All commands except `eject` will still function, but they will now use these copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. At this stage, you are responsible for managing these configurations yourself.

Using `eject` is not mandatory. The standard configuration is suitable for small to medium-sized projects, and you shouldn't feel pressured to use this feature. However, we recognize that the tool's utility is enhanced by the ability to customize when needed.
